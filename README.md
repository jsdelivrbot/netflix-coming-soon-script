# Netflix Coming Soon Script

It's just a bookmarklet (unofficial, obviously) that checks if a Netflix title is going to appear soon in your country or not. To do that you need to run the script first on a third-party Netflix search engine (supported currently: UnoGS, Flicksurfer, Flixlist, Moreflix) and then, on the Netflix page itself.
